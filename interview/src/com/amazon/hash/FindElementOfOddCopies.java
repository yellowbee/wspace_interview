 * Given an array of integer in which all numbers occur even

 * 
 * Solution: Traverse the array and use a set. If an element is
 * not in the set, add it to the set; if it's already in the set,
 * remove the one in the set. The only element left in the set
 * at the end is the one we are looking for.
